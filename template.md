Sub: Review Request from PCE WG co-chairs

Hi <$name>,

In an effort to expedite the processing of items in the WG queues [1][2] and to encourage more active participation and feedback, we have decided to request some of the authors whose documents are also in the queue. We kindly request your assistance in reviewing drafts that are currently in the adoption/WGLC. This is essential for ensuring that the working group's outputs are thoroughly examined and that any consensus (or lack thereof) is appropriately reflected in our mailing list discussions.

At present, we have <$draft-name> [3] undergoing <WG adoption|WGLC> call, and we would greatly appreciate it if you could take a moment to review this draft and share your feedback within the WG mailing list thread [4].

Thank you for your cooperation and support.

Thanks,

Dhruv & Julien

PCE Co-chairs
